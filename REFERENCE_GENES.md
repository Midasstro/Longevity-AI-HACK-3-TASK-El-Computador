In yeast, Sir2 family proteins (sirtuins) regulate gene silencing, recombination, DNA repair, and aging via histone deacetylation. Most of the seven mammalian sirtuins (Sirt1–Sirt7) have been implicated as NAD+ -dependent protein deacetylases with targets ranging from transcriptional regulators to metabolic enzymes. We report that neural-specific deletion of sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) in mice leads to postnatal growth retardation due to somatotropic attenuation through low growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels. However, unlike Sirt6 null mice, neural Sirt6-deleted mice do not die from hypoglycemia. Instead, over time, neural Sirt6-deleted mice reach normal size and ultimately become obese. Molecularly, Sirt6 deletion results in striking hyperacetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and lysine 56 (H3K56), two chromatin marks implicated in the regulation of gene activity and chromatin structure, in various brain regions including those involved in neuroendocrine regulation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that Sirt6 functions as a central regulator of somatic growth and plays an important role in preventing obesity by modulating neural chromatin structure and gene activity.

Sirtuins have been linked to metabolic regulation, stress toler-ance, and aging (1, 2). It is still unclear whether mammalian sirtuins function as longevity assurance factors; but they may have therapeutic potential for age-associated diseases (1). Seven mammalian sirtuins (Sirt1–Sirt7) are known and localize to various subcellular compartments (1, 2). Sirt6 is a chromatin-associated nuclear protein affecting DNA repair, telomere maintenance, gene expression, and metabolism (3–9). Sirt6-deficient (Sirt6−/<sup>−</sup> ) mice suffer from a severe, multisystemic phenotype and have a short lifespan (3, 4). This precludes studies of Sirt6 function in adult mice and makes it difficult to distinguish primary versus secondary consequences of Sirt6 loss. Postnatal growth retardation associated with low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels is a prominent feature of Sirt6−/<sup>−</sup> mice (4). Because brain homeostatic centers control somatic growth and IGF1 levels (10), and Sirt6 is highly expressed in the central nervous system (4, 11, 12), we hypothesized that loss of neural Sirt6 contributes to these aspects of the Sirt6 deficient mouse phenotype.

## Results and Discussion

To circumvent the problem of early postnatal lethality of Sirt6−/<sup>−</sup> mice and to study the biological role of Sirt6 in the central nervous system, we generated neural-specific Sirt6 knockout mice (BS6ko) by crossing mice carrying a conditional Sirt6 allele (6), in which exons 2 and 3 are flanked by LoxP sites, to Nestin-Cre (NCre) transgenic mice (13). BS6ko mice showed efficient Sirt6 deletion, as determined at both DNA and protein levels, in the brain but not in other tissues (Figs. 1A and [Fig. S1\)](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF1). Consistent with NCremediated deletion not occurring in the anterior pituitary (13, 14), Sirt6 expression in this organ was similar in BS6ko and Sirt6 wildtype (WT) mice (Fig. 1A). BS6ko mice appeared normal at birth and gross macroscopic and histological examination of 3-wk-old BS6ko brains did not reveal any abnormalities ([Fig. S2](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF2)). However, at 4 wk of age, BS6ko mice were significantly smaller (Fig. 1B) and weighed less (Fig. 1C) than littermate controls (Sirt6+/+/NCre, Sirt6+/+, Sirt6c/+, or Sirt6c/c; all hereafter referred to as WT). In contrast, no growth retardation occurred in Sirt6c/+ mice containing the NCre allele (BS6het) (Fig. 1 C and D). Growth retardation in BS6ko occurred in both genders, but was more pronounced in males (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that neural Sirt6 inactivation is sufficient to cause growth retardation comparable to that observed in Sirt6−/<sup>−</sup> mice.

Unlike Sirt6−/<sup>−</sup> mice (3, 4), BS6ko mice did not show progressive hypoglycemia; blood glucose levels were slightly lower but still within normoglycemic range in 3-wk-old BS6ko mice [\(Fig. S3\)](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF3). Subsequently, BS6ko mice gradually grew in size and weight and by 6–7 wk of age became indistinguishable from WT mice (Fig. 1D). To test whether reduced ability to compete for maternal resources during the postnatal period was a cause of growth retardation in BS6ko mice, we performed cross-fostering experiments. Raising BS6ko pups in the absence of WT pups did not rescue or alleviate the growth retardation phenotype (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, despite being small, BS6ko pups were not physically impaired [\(Movie S1](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/sm01.mov)) and actually displayed slightly higher locomotor activity ([Fig. S4\)](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF4). These results suggest that an intrinsic endocrine defect potentially causes growth retardation of BS6ko mice.

Sirt6−/<sup>−</sup> mice routinely have low levels of IGF1 (4), a stable indicator of growth hormone (GH) secretion and, together with GH, the major regulator of postnatal growth (10). We measured IGF1 serum levels in 4-wk-old BS6ko mice; similar to Sirt6−/<sup>−</sup> mice, BS6ko had very low levels of circulating IGF1 (Fig. 2A). GH is secreted in pulsatile fashion by the pituitary in response to stimulation by hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (10). Albeit smaller, pituitaries from BS6ko mice appeared grossly normal. Histological examination revealed that acidophils, which are mostly somatotrophs that produce GH (10), were present in the anterior pituitary; however, they were reduced in number and

smaller in size than normal somatotrophs, with only a thin rim of cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B and C). Consistent with these observations, pituitaries from BS6ko mice contained much less GH (Fig. 2D). GH deficiency appeared specific and not due to a generalized pituitary dysfunction because BS6ko mice displayed normal levels of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH; [Fig. S5](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF5)). Whereas the specific cause of reduced somatotroph number and function remains to be determined, it does not appear to be due to a primary pituitary defect, because Sirt6 was not deleted in this organ. Furthermore, GH deficiency caused by primary pituitary defects is usually associated with altered hypothalamic GHRH and somatotropin releaseinhibiting hormone (SRIH) expression (10). Despite very low levels of GH, we found normal GHRH and SRIH transcript levels in hypothalami from 4-wk-old BS6ko mice ([Fig. S6](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF6)), suggesting that feedback mechanisms between pituitary and hypothalamus are dysfunctional and that the attenuation of the somatotropic axis in BS6ko mice is caused by impaired hypothalamic function. We presently cannot exclude other potential explanations, e.g., altered GHRH and SRIH transcript levels at earlier time points, altered protein levels of these factors, or other hypothalamic defects caused by Sirt6 ablation. Overall, our findings show that loss of neural Sirt6 compromises the somatotropic axis and argue for a central role of neural Sirt6 in somatic growth regulation.

Examination of older BS6ko mice revealed that body weights of 6- to 12-mo-old female BS6ko mice were indistinguishable from those of control littermates [\(Fig. S7\)](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF7). However, 6- to 12-mo-old male BS6ko mice were significantly heavier than age-matched BS6het or WT littermate controls (Fig. 3A). Notably, adult BS6ko mice of both genders continued to display lower IGF1 serum levels (Fig. 3B) and smaller brains than controls (Fig. 3 C and D). In contrast, no differences in body length between BS6ko and control mice were found (Fig. 3 E and H). Strikingly, both female and male BS6ko mice maintained on a normal chow diet showed increased adiposity by about 6–8 mo of age (Fig. 3 F, G, I, and J); this phenotype became quite pronounced with age (Fig. 3K). Obesity in humans can be caused by reduced hypothalamic levels of any one

of the neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin (Pomc), single-minded homolog 1 (Sim1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) (15). We found reduced levels of all three factors in hypothalami from BS6ko mice (Fig. 3L). Our data demonstrate that neuralspecific Sirt6 deletion, likely through reduced GH and hypothalamic neuropeptide levels, promotes adult-onset obesity in mice.

To functionally assess the molecular role of neural Sirt6, we next investigated the consequences of neural Sirt6 loss on histone acetylation. Neural histone acetylation status is important for neural processes and is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, depression, addiction, and neurodevelopmental disorders (16, 17). However, factors responsible for the dynamic modulation of histone acetylation in the brain remain largely obscure. Sirt6 can deacetylate both H3K9 (7–9) and H3K56 (18, 19), two chromatin marks associated with regulation of gene activity (20–22). We analyzed H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) in various brain regions from WT and BS6ko mice. Loss of Sirt6 resulted in H3K9 hyperacetylation in hippocampus and hypothalamus (Fig. 4A), showing that Sirt6 is a major H3K9 deacetylase in these brain regions. Moreover, loss of Sirt6 caused dramatic H3K56 hyperacetylation (H3K56ac) in whole cell extracts from hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Fig. 4B); and similar results were obtained with purified whole brain nuclei (Fig. 4C). To confirm that H3K56ac is chromatin associated, we analyzed acid-extracted histones from purified cortical nuclei (Fig. 4 D and E); again, Sirt6 deficiency resulted in dramatic H3K9 and H3K56 hyperacetylation. In contrast, hyperacetylation did not occur in BS6het brains (Fig. 4F). Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we confirmed H3K56 hyperacetylation in individual hippocampal CA1 neurons (Fig. 4G). Global acetylation levels of other lysines in histone H3 or H4 were not affected by loss of Sirt6 ([Fig. S8](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF8)), demonstrating that Sirt6 is specific for H3K9 and H3K56. Together, these results demonstrate that Sirt6 is the major

H3K9 and H3K56 deacetylase in the brain, suggesting potential roles in regulation of gene activity.

Here, we have addressed the physiological consequences of loss of neural Sirt6 in mice (schematically illustrated in Fig. 4H). Our data establish Sirt6 as a major neural histone deacetylase with important potential implications for common human diseases. Remarkably, Sirt6 deficiency causes dramatically increased H3K9 and H3K56 acetylation, despite the presence of several other histone deacetylases in the brain, including Sirt1 and Sirt2. Recent work has implicated neural Sirt1 as a positive regulator of the somatotropic axis (14). In contrast to BS6ko mice, neural-specific Sirt1 knockout mice are not growth retarded at 4 wk of age but show reduced body weight and length later in life (14).

Our findings link neural Sirt6 to GH/IGF1 signaling, a pathway conserved across phyla that affects lifespan, metabolism, cancer, and neurodegeneration (23, 24)—suggesting that pharmacologic modulation of neural Sirt6 might have therapeutic value. In this regard, reduced IGF1 signaling lowers proteotoxicity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (25). On the other hand, IGF1 also is neurotrophic and promotes learning and memory in humans and animal models, and low levels of serum IGF1 are etiologically tied to agingassociated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases (26). Somatotropic attenuation, such as we now report in BS6ko mice, extends lifespan in mice (23, 24, 27). As we have not yet performed systematic lifespan studies, we do not know whether lifespan of BS6ko mice is altered. Clearly, such future studies will be of interest.

BS6ko mice have low pituitary GH, as well as reduced hypothalamic Pomc, Sim1, and Bdnf levels, and become obese during adult life. Correspondingly, low levels of these factors have been linked to obesity in both mice and man (10, 15, 23). Further work will be necessary to define the specific role of Sirt6 in the hypothalamus and to delineate the role of Sirt6 in neurons versus other neural cell types.

Recent findings demonstrating that liver-specific deletion of Sirt6 inmice causes fatty liver formation (6), and that mice overexpressing Sirt6 are protected against diet-induced obesity (28) further highlight the importance of Sirt6 in the context of nutrient metabolism. Overall, BS6ko mice will provide a useful model for further exploration of potential beneficial or adverse physiological effects of down-regulating neural Sirt6 over the mouse lifespan. In summary, our findings establish neural Sirt6 as a regulator of the somatic growth axis and a potential disease factor for adult-onset obesity.

## Materials and Methods

Mice. The institutional animal care and use committee of Children's Hospital Boston approved all animal work. A conditional Sirt6 knockout allele was generated using standard gene targeting procedures by flanking exons 2 and 3 by LoxP recombination sites (6). Nestin-Cre (NCre) transgenic mice were described (13). BS6ko (Sirt6c/c/NCre), BS6het (Sirt6c/+/NCre), and WT (Sirt6+/+/NCre, Sirt6+/+, Sirt6c/+, or Sirt6c/c) mice were generated by crossing appropriate females to Sirt6c/+/NCre males and littermates were used in all experiments. PCR genotyping conditions are described in [SI Materials and](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=STXT) [Methods](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1016306107/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201016306SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=STXT). Mice were fed a standard chow diet and maintained on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. Blood glucose was measured using the One Touch Ultra 2 blood glucose monitoring system (Life Scan).

Histological Analysis. Tissues were fixed in Bouin's solution, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned (5 μm). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed using standard methods. Perfusion fixation of brain tissue was done as described (29).

Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Body fat content was analyzed in mice anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine using a fully integrated PIXImus 2 scanner (GE Healthcare Lunar).

Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy. These experiments were performed as previously described (16).

Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting. Microdissected brain regions were extracted in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, Roche), and briefly sonicated. Protein concentration was determined (Biorad Protein DC assay) and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS/PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (anti-histone H3 (Abcam), anti-histone H3 acetyl (K56) (Epitomics), anti-histone H3 acetyl (K9) (Abcam, Millipore), anti-Sirt6 (Abcam, Novus), anti-tubulin (Sigma) and anti-Hsp60 (Enzo Life Sciences)).

Preparation of Brain Nuclei and Histone Extraction. Brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (10 mM Hepes-KOH, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 3.3 μM trichostatin A, 20 mM nicotinamide, pH 7.5). Nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation (600 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), resuspended in buffer B (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2), layered over a cushion of buffer C (0.88 M sucrose, 0.5 mM MgCl2), and centrifuged (2,800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Purified nuclei were washed in buffer B and sedimented (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). All buffers contained protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, Roche). Histones were extracted according to published procedures (30).

Other evidence for the gene's association with aging

Research details and links	Reference (DOI, PMID)
Typical HGPS (Progeria Hutchinson-Guildford) fibroblasts express lower levels of SIRT6 than fibroblasts from normal and atypical HGPS donors. Experimental induction of progerin did not cause a detectable reduction of SIRT6 protein. However, overexpression of SIRT6 in HGPS cells was associated with a reduced frequency of SA-β-gal positivity, fewer misshapen nuclei, fewer DNA damage foci, and increased growth rates.

Summary
Evolution
Sirtuins were discovered in yeast (Sir2) as histone deacetylases, later found that they have various other enzymatic functions. It is a very ancient family, members found both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and multicellular organisms have more than one sirtuin gene in their genomes. Based on a phylogenetic comparison of sirtuins, it was proposed that eukaryotic cells gained ancestral sirtuin sequences by two or three independent engulfment events The connection between sirtuins and aging processes is conserved in eukaryote species source but implied throughout different molecular pathways source. Sirtuins have conserved catalytic core and variable terminal regions, determining unique interactors source. All sirtuins, including nuclear and mitochondrial, have nuclear export signaling, which indicates they have or had functions in the cytoplasm source. According to the homology of full sequences, sirtuins are classified into four classes. SIRT6 is a nuclear sirtuin from class IV, identified only in eukaryotes. It has a conserved function of DNA repair source. The N terminal domain is highly homologous to SIRT7 from the same class source. Mammalian SIRT6 has a wide spectrum of molecular targets and is involved in various biological processes source. In primates, SIRT6 gained an essential role for fetal development source
Gene description
This gene encodes a member of the sirtuin family of NAD-dependent enzymes that are implicated in cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, aging and energy homeostasis. The encoded protein is localized to the nucleus, exhibits ADP-ribosyl transferase and histone deacetylase activities, and plays a role in DNA repair, maintenance of telomeric chromatin, inflammation, lipid and glucose metabolism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016].

Has very weak deacetylase activity and can bind NAD(+) in the absence of acetylated substrate (PubMed:21362626). Has deacetylase activity towards histone H3K9Ac and H3K56Ac (PubMed:19625767, PubMed:21362626). Modulates acetylation of histone H3 in telomeric chromatin during the S-phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:19625767). May also be required for the association of WRN with telomeres during S-phase and for normal telomere maintenance (PubMed:18337721). Deacetylates histone H3K9Ac at NF-kappa-B target promoters and may down-regulate the expression of a subset of NF-kappa-B target genes (PubMed:21362626). Deacetylation of nucleosomes interferes with RELA binding to target DNA (PubMed:19135889). Acts as a corepressor of the transcription factor Hif1a to control the expression of multiple glycolytic genes to regulate glucose homeostasis (By similarity). Required for normal IGF1 serum levels and normal glucose homeostasis (By similarity). Regulates the production of TNF protein (By similarity). Has a role in the regulation of life span (By similarity).

## **Abstract**

In the adult central nervous system, the vasculature of the neurogenic niche regulates neural stem cell behavior by providing circulating and secreted factors. Age-related decline of neurogenesis and cognitive function is associated with reduced blood flow and decreased numbers of neural stem cells. Therefore, restoring the functionality of the niche should counteract some of the negative effects of aging. We show that factors found in young blood induce vascular remodeling, culminating in increased neurogenesis and improved olfactory discrimination in aging mice. Further, we show that GDF11 alone can improve the cerebral vasculature and enhance neurogenesis. The identification of factors that slow the age-dependent deterioration of the neurogenic niche in mice may constitute the basis for new methods of treating age-related neurodegenerative and neurovascular diseases.

> In the adult brain, neural stem cells reside in a three-dimensional heterogeneous niche where they are in direct contact with blood vessels and the cerebrospinal fluid. The vasculature can influence neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation by providing a local source of signaling molecules secreted from endothelial cells (1) as well as by delivering systemic regulatory factors (2). The hormone prolactin (3), dietary restriction (4) and an exercise/ enriched environment (5), positively modulate neurogenesis, whereas increased levels of glucocorticoids associated with stress have the opposite effect (6). In the aging niche, the vasculature deteriorates with a consequent reduction in blood flow (7), and the neurogenic potential of neural stem cells declines, leading to reduced neuroplasticity and cognition (8-10). Systemic factors can also affect these aging-associated events, either positively

where circulating monocytes enhance remyelination in aged mice (11, 12) or negatively where the accumulation of chemokines in old blood can reduce neurogenesis and cognition in young mice (10).

To test if the age-related decline of the neurogenic niche can be restored by extrinsic young signals, we used a mouse heterochronic parabiosis model. Our experiments reveal a remodeling of the aged cerebral vasculature in response to young systemic factors, producing noticeably greater blood flow, as well as activation of subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cell proliferation and enhanced olfactory neurogenesis leading to an improvement in olfactory function. Furthermore, we tested GDF11, a circulating TGF-β family member that reverses cardiac hypertrophy in aged mice (13), and found that it can also stimulate vascular remodeling and increase neurogenesis in aging mice. Thus, we have observed that age-dependent remodeling of this niche is reversible by systemic intervention.

To test our hypothesis we generated heterochronic parabiotic pairs between 15-month old (Het-O) and 2-month old (Het-Y) male mice, as well as control groups of age-matched pairs, namely isochronic young (Iso-Y) and isochronic old (Iso-O) pairs (Fig.S1). The average lifespan of this strain of mice in the National Institute of Aging's growth conditions is 27 months. All parabiotic pairs remained surgically joined for 5 weeks (14). Because aging leads to a reduced number of progenitor cells (15-17), we assessed how heterochronic parabiosis can affect the SVZ neural stem cell populations by analyzing coronal SVZ sections (Fig.S2A) of heterochronic and isochronic brains for different SVZ stem/progenitor cell types, such as proliferative Ki67+ cells, Sox2+ stem cells and Olig2+ transit amplifying progenitors (Fig.1A, B, C respectively). Quantification of these sections revealed an increase of 26.9% for Ki67+ cells (Fig.S2B), 112% for Sox2+ cells (Fig.1D) and 57% for Olig2+ cells (Fig.1E) in the Het-O compared to the Iso-O SVZ. However, these cell populations were unaffected in the Het-Y mice (Fig.S2C and Fig.1 D, E). Systemic factors in old blood can have detrimental effects on hippocampal neurogenesis in young animals (10); however, we saw no decrease in neural stem/progenitor cell numbers in the SVZ of young mice joined to 15-month old partners. We wondered if this discrepancy was related to differences between the SVZ and the hippocampus or to the fact that our old animals were younger than the old animals used in the previous study. We therefore joined 2-month old mice with 21-month old mice (Fig.S3A) and found that the older blood negatively affected young SVZ neurogenesis, as Het-Y21 mice showed decreased proliferative Ki67+ (Fig.S3B, D) and Sox2+ cell populations (Fig.S3C, E) in the SVZ compared to Iso-Y mice. These data are consistent with the previously reported negative effect of older blood on hippocampal neurogenesis (10) and indicate an age-dependent accumulation of factors in the blood of older mice that affect neurogenic zones in both the hippocampus and SVZ.

Aging results in longer cell cycle times in precursor cells isolated from the SVZ (18). To assess the effect of heterochronic parabiosis on neural stem cell proliferation, we cultured neural stem cells from parabiotic brains as neurospheres (19,20). After the first passage, neurospheres derived from the Het-O SVZ were 43% larger in diameter than those derived from the Iso-O SVZ (Fig. S4) and, after removal of growth factors, they generated ∼2.5-fold more TuJ1+ neurons than the Iso-O (Fig. S5). This suggests that neural stem cells exposed to young systemic factors increase their ability to proliferate and differentiate into neurons.

Collectively, these data demonstrate that youthful circulating factors can restore the selfrenewal and differentiation potential of aged SVZ stem cells, and this effect can persist for some time after isolation from the mouse brain.

Adult SVZ neural stem and progenitor cells differentiate into neuroblasts and migrate through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb where they mature into interneurons (21). We asked if the increase in neural stem and progenitor cells could produce a subsequent change in olfactory neurogenesis in the Het-O mice. We pulsed parabiotic pairs with BrdU to label newborn neurons, and after 3 weeks the mice were analyzed for BrdU+/ NeuN+ cells to quantify newborn neurons (Fig. 2A). As expected from our *in vitro* studies, we observed increased olfactory neurogenesis *in vivo*. Het-O newborn neuron populations were enriched by 92% compared to Iso-O populations (Fig. 2B). In accordance with our above results, the number of new neurons in Het-Y mice was only slightly negatively affected, although the decrease was not statistically significant (Fig. 2C).

To test the functional significance of these findings, we performed an olfaction assay where naïve single parabionts, separated from their parabiotic partners after 5 weeks, were exposed to different concentrations of an odorant (22). After a short habituation period, each parabiont was presented with different concentrations of an odorant, and the total time that each parabiont spent exploring the odorant for each concentration was measured. In this assay, Het-O (Fig. 2D) and young control (Fig. 2D) mice both spent more time exploring a low concentration of odorant (diluted 10<sup>5</sup> times), whereas a high concentration (10-fold diluted) produced a negative response. By comparison, Iso-O mice spent roughly the same amount of time exploring the odorant regardless of its concentration (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that Het-O mice have a higher olfactory discrimination than the Iso-O mice. Therefore, exposure of the neurogenic niche to young systemic factors enhances functional neurogenesis, culminating in improved olfactory behavior.

Cerebrovascular architecture, capillary density and cerebral blood flow have been reported to decline with aging (23-25). Given the interconnection between the vasculature and neural stem cells, we asked if young blood factors can also rejuvenate blood vessel architecture and function. To test this we created "angiograms", 3D reconstructions of the blood vessels (Fig. S6A). Volumetric analysis of these angiograms showed that aging causes a decrease in blood vessel volume, as expected (Fig. 3A, B). However, heterochronic parabiosis reversed this decline, increasing blood vessel volume by 87% in the Het-O compared to the Iso-O group (Fig. 3A, B). Furthermore, we observed that blood vessel branching increased by 21% in Het-O versus Iso-O mice (Fig. S6B). Some blood vessels in the Het-O mice were not associated with AQP4+ astrocytic endfeet, suggesting that these vessels are newly formed and potentially leaky, thus providing NSCs with enhanced nutritive support (Fig. S6E). This phenomenon of vascular remodeling in the Het-O mice extended to other neurogenic areas like the hippocampus (Fig. S7A, B) and also to non-neurogenic areas like the cortex (Fig. S7C). To test if the increased blood vessel volume led to functional improvement, we measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the parabiotic mice (Fig. 3E), since CBF is known to decrease with aging (27). We found that heterochronic parabiosis indeed restored CBF to the levels seen in young animals (Fig. 3C, D E), indicating that the vascular remodeling observed in Het-O mice changes the

hemodynamics of the vascular system in the CNS. Young vasculature, on the contrary, retained the same volumetric (Fig. 3A, B), blood flow (Fig. S6D), and branching (Fig. S6C) characteristics in both isochronic and heterochronic parabiosis.

New vessels can form either by sprouting from existing capillaries or *de novo* from circulating endothelial progenitors. To test which of these mechanisms is taking place we parabiotically joined young GFP mice with old non-GFP mice for 5 weeks. Analysis of these brains excluded any detectable contribution of young circulating endothelial progenitors to the vascular remodeling in Het-O animals (Fig. S8). As pericytes play a role in vasoconstriction in capillaries (26), we sought to investigate if their numbers were altered by heterochronic parabiosis. The number of pericytes associated with blood vessels was unaffected by parabiosis (Fig. S9). The likelihood that systemic factors can act directly on endothelial cells was further supported when we cultured primary mouse brain capillary endothelial cells and treated them with serum isolated from either young or old mice. Young serum stimulated endothelial cell proliferation by 88% compared to old serum (Fig. S10).

Several factors, including Sonic Hedgehog, erythropoietin, nitric oxide, Notch ligands, Fibroblast Growth Factor and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (28-31), that affect neurogenesis are also involved in blood vessel maintenance and proliferation. Of most relevance to our study are those factors that decrease with aging. Recently, one such factor, GDF11/BMP11, a circulating member of the BMP/TGF-β family, was found to be present in higher concentrations in young and heterochronic old than in old mouse serum. GDF11 administration to older mice reproduces many of the beneficial effects of parabiosis on aging hypertrophic cardiac muscle (13). This prompted us to test if GDF11 could also restore the age-related decline in neurogenesis and participate in vascular remodeling. For that purpose, 21-23 month old mice were treated with daily injections of either recombinant GDF11 (rGDF11, 0.1mg/kg mouse body weight), a dosing regimen that increases GDF11 levels in old mice toward youthful levels (30), or PBS (vehicle) for 4 weeks and their blood vessels were subsequently analyzed using the volumetric assay described above. The volume of blood vessels in GDF11-treated old mice increased by 50% compared to the PBS-treated mice (Fig. 4A, C). Moreover, the population of Sox2+ cells in GDF11-treated old mice increased by 29% compared to the control (Fig. 4B, D).

*In vitro* experiments confirmed that GDF11 acts, at least in part, on brain capillary endothelial cells. First, treating endothelial cells with rGDF11 (40ng/ml) activates the wellknown TGF-β signaling pathway in these cells, revealed by an increase in SMAD phosphorylation cascade (Fig. 4E, F). Second, a 6-day treatment of primary brain capillary endothelial cells with rGDF11 (40ng/ml) increased their proliferation by 22.9% compared to controls (Fig.S11), but not in the presence of a TGF-β inhibitor (Fig.S12), confirming that GDF11 has a direct biological effect on these cells through the p-SMAD pathway.

The physiology of the brain is intimately dependent on its vasculature during aging. In the normal brain there is a close association between stimulation of neural stem cells and blood vessels in the SVZ (4-6) and in the dentate gyrus. Here we show that heterochronic parabiosis increases neurogenesis and improves vascularity and blood flow of the neurogenic niche. GDF11, a factor that also rejuvenates heart and skeletal muscle in aged

mice (35), also was able to increase blood flow and neurogenesis in aged mice. Its effects were not as large as those of parabiosis itself, although that may relate to using sub-optimal doses of this factor. In addition, some of its actions may be direct, and others may be indirect. Additional experiments will be needed to address this issue.

A question that arises from our work relates to aging-associated changes in the balance of positively- and negatively-acting circulating factors. We show here that blood from 15 month old mice does not have a detrimental effect on young mice whereas older blood (21 month old) dramatically decreases neural stem cell populations in the young brain, an effect also observed in the hippocampus (10). This observation suggests that there is an age at which deleterious systemic factors accumulate and/or young factors are reduced. However, regardless of the age of the old brain, we and others (10, 11) have shown that young blood is still able to rejuvenate the aged brain.

In conclusion, circulating factors, specifically including GDF11, have diverse positive effects in aging mice, including enhancing neurogenesis. Interestingly, aging also affects the microvascular network in non-neurogenic regions of the brain (7). Circulating factors improved the vasculature in the cortex, as well as in other parts of the aging mouse brain. It is possible that increased blood flow might result in increased neural activity and function, opening new therapeutic strategies for treating age-related neurodegenerative conditions.

Other evidence for the gene's association with aging

| Findings | DOI/PMID |
|----------|----------|
| GDF11 homolog (myostatin) declines in healthy men with aging, but GDF11 levels don't differ by age in women. In older adults with aortic stenosis, higher GDF11 was associated with frailty, diabetes, cardiac conditions, and post-surgical complications. GDF11 doesn't decline with age but correlates with comorbidities in cardiovascular disease. | [10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.023) |

Summary
Evolution
GDF11 encodes Growth Differentiation Factor 11, which is one of the TGF-beta family proteins. TGF-beta family expanded in parallel with the expansion of Wnt and Frizzled genes, as regulators of complicating multicellularity. GDF11 has close paralog GDF8 (also known as myostatin), GDF8 and GDF11 separated from common ancestral gene after vertebrates diverged from other chordates source. This ancestral gene in invertebrates has opposite functions in growth regulation comparing with vertebrate GDF11 source. Drosophila homolog of GDF11 acts as an aging regulator source. GDF11 is highly conserved in vertebrate sequences in terms of mature domains and also prodomains source. Also, despite the high homology of GDF11 to closest paralog GDF8 in mature domains, their prodomains are diverse source, pointing to the importance of prodomain for implementing unique functions.
Gene description
This gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer. This protein plays a role in the development of the nervous and other organ systems, and may regulate aging. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016].
Protein description (UniProt)
Secreted signal that acts globally to specify positional identity along the anterior/posterior axis during development. May play critical roles in patterning both mesodermal and neural tissues and in establishing the skeletal pattern (By similarity). Signals through activin receptors type-2, ACVR2A and ACVR2B, and activin receptors type-1, ACVR1B, ACVR1C and TGFBR1 leading to the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (PubMed:28257634).

#### Summary

Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) knockout (KO) mice, generated through homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, have a significantly increased lifespan compared to wild-type littermates. However, it is unknown whether this longevity advantage would pertain to PAPP-A gene deletion in adult animals. In the present study, we used tamoxifen (Tam) inducible Cre recombinase-mediated excision of the floxed PAPP-A (fPAPP-A) gene in mice at 5 months of age. fPAPP-A mice, which were either positive (pos) or negative (neg) for Tam-Cre, received Tam treatment with quarterly boosters. Only female mice could be used with this experimental design. fPAPP-A/neg and fPAPP-A/pos mice had similar weights at the start of the experiment and showed equivalent weight gain. We found that fPAPP-A/pos mice had a significant extension of life span (P = 0.005). The median life span was increased by 21% for fPAPP-A/pos compared to fPAPP-A/neg mice. Analysis of mortality in life span quartiles indicated that the proportion of deaths of fPAPP-A/pos mice were lower than fPAPP-A/neg mice at young adult ages (P = 0.002 for 601–800 days) and higher than fPAPP-A/ neg mice at older ages (P = 0.004 for >1000 days). Thus, survival curves and age-specific mortality indicate that female mice with knockdown of PAPP-A gene expression as adults have an extended healthy life span.

Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is the founding member of pappalysins in the metzincin superfamily of metalloproteinases (Boldt et al., 2001). Its only known function to date is to enhance local insulin-like growth factor (IGF) availability for receptor activation through cleavage of inhibitory IGF binding proteins (Conover, 2012; Oxvig, 2015). As reduced IGF signaling has been shown to increase life span in a wide variety of species (Bartke, 2008), we postulated that loss of PAPP-A would suppress IGF receptor signaling and extend life span. This was proven true in that both male and female PAPP-A knockout (KO) mice lived significantly longer than their wild-type littermates (Conover & Bale, 2007; Conover et al., 2010). The PAPP-A KO mice were also resistant to the development of several age-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis (Harrington et al., 2007). However, these mice were generated through

homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (Conover et al., 2004). To distinguish the impact of PAPP-A deficiency in the adult from that during fetal and early postnatal development, we developed a mouse model suitable for tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible, Cre recombinasemediated excision of the PAPP-A gene (Conover et al., 2013a). In an atherosclerosis-prone mouse model, Tam administration in adult mice inhibited established atherosclerotic plaque progression by 70% (Bale et al., 2014). In this study, we sought to answer the question of whether conditional reduction of PAPP-A gene expression in adult mice would result in extended life span.

Female mice homozygous for floxed PAPP-A (fPAPP-A) and either positive (pos) or negative (neg) for Tam-Cre were used in the life span study. Cre-mediated excision and recombination were induced in fivemonth-old fPAPP-A/pos mice with intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Tam (20 mg mL<sup>1</sup> ) in corn oil with 2% ethanol. fPAPP-A/neg mice also received ip Tam as a control for any non-specific effects of Tam treatment. Male mice could not be used in this life span study because Tam treatment can result in scrotal enlargement and subsequent complications, such as herniation (Reinert et al., 2012).The initial injection was with 6 mg of Tam/40 g body weight (bw) and then with 3 mg Tam/40 g bw weekly for 3 weeks. We had shown previously that this regimen produced maximum efficiency of excision in adult mice while limiting toxicity (Conover et al., 2013a). A 3 mg Tam/40 g bw ip booster was given every 4 months, thereafter, to induce excision and recombination in tissues that undergo considerable cell turnover. (Fig. S1, Supporting information, excision in the different tissues). Mice were examined daily throughout the study, including weekends and holidays. In spite of this monitoring, 17 fPAPP-A/pos and 14 fPAPP-A/neg mice were found dead in cage the next day. Mice were considered to be at end of life and euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, according to American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines, if they were moribund and demonstrated one or more clinical signs suggesting imminent death: nonresponsive to being touched, labored breathing, failure to eat or drink. Mice euthanized because of ulcerative dermatitis unresponsive to treatment (five fPAPP-A/neg; four fPAPP-A/pos) were not included in the life span analyses. Inability to confirm genotypes at harvest also resulted in removal of mice from the analyses.

fPAPP-A/neg and fPAPP-A/pos mice had similar weights at the start of the experiment and showed equivalent weight gain up to 17 months of age Table S1 (Supporting Information). Survival distribution is presented in Fig. 1. We found that fPAPP-A/pos mice had a significant extension of life span (P < 0.005). The median life span was increased by 21% for fPAPP-A/pos compared to fPAPP-A/neg mice. Mortality in life span quartiles (Fig. 2) indicates that the proportion of deaths of fPAPP-A/pos mice were lower than fPAPP-A/neg mice at young adult ages (P = 0.002 for 601–800 days) and higher than fPAPP-A/neg mice at older ages (P = 0.004 for >1000 days).

This study is the first to show that downregulation of PAPP-A expression in adult mice can significantly extend life span. Importantly, this beneficial longevity phenotype is distinct from the dwarfism of longlived PAPP-A KO, Ames dwarf, Snell dwarf and growth hormone receptor (GHR) KO mice with germ-line mutations (Conover et al., 2004;

Bartke, 2008). Thus, downregulation of PAPP-A expression joins other treatment regimens, such as resveratrol, rapamycin and dietary restriction, which can extend life span when started in mice as adults (Weindruch & Walford, 1982; Baur et al., 2006; Harrison et al., 2009). In a recent study, inducible knockdown of the GHR in young adult female mice increased maximal, but not median, life span (Junilla et al., 2016). Tissue-specific PAPP-A KO models would provide insight into the tissues and organs that contribute to extended life span and healthspan.

An advantage of targeting PAPP-A is the expectation of limited adverse side effects. We have already shown that global elimination of PAPP-A gene expression has multiple positive effects, for example, resistance to: atherosclerotic plaque progression (Harrington et al., 2007), thymic involution and immune senescence (Vallejo et al., 2009), development of diabetic nephropathy (Mader et al., 2013), and visceral obesity (Conover et al., 2013b). One could also inhibit PAPP-A's proteolytic activity to reduce IGF bioavailability for receptor activation. We have an immunoneutralizing monoclonal antibody specific for PAPP-A (Mikkelsen et al., 2014), which has shown beneficial effects on ovarian cancer patient tumorgrafts in immunocompromised mice and on atherosclerotic plaque progression in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (Becker et al., 2015; Conover et al., 2016). Although these were studies performed in mice, there is growing evidence that PAPP-A plays a role in atherosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, visceral obesity, and several cancers in humans (Bayes-Genis et al., 2001; Bulut et al., 2009; Conover, 2012; Huang et al., 2013; Mader et al., 2013; Henning et al., 2016). Thus, these data are foundational for pursuing small-molecule inhibitors of PAPP-A's proteolytic activity to promote healthy lifespan in humans.

## Abstract

Background: Chronic low-grade inflammation is considered a driver of many age-related disorders, including vascular diseases (inflammaging). Inhibition of autophagic capacity with ageing was postulated to generate a pro-inflammatory condition via activation of inflammasomes, a group of Interleukin-1 activating intracellular multi-protein complexes. We thus investigated gene expression of inflammasome components in PBMC of 77 vascular patients (age 22–82) in association with age.

Findings: Linear regression of real-time qRT-PCR data revealed a significant positive association of gene expression of each of the inflammasome components with age (Pearson correlation coefficients: AIM2: r = 0.245; P = 0.032; NLRP3: r = 0.367; P = 0.001; ASC (PYCARD): r = 0.252; P = 0.027; CASP1: r = 0.296; P = 0.009; CASP5: r = 0.453; P = 0.00003; IL1B: r = 0.247; P = 0.030). No difference in gene expression of AIM2, NLRP3, ASC CASP1, and CASP5 was detected between PBMC of patients with advanced atherosclerosis and other vascular patients, whereas IL1B expression was increased in PBMC of the latter group (P = 0.0005).

Conclusion: The findings reinforce the systemic pro-inflammatory phenotype reported in elderly by demonstrating an increased phase-1 activation of inflammasomes in PBMC of vascular patients.

## Findings

## Background

The concept of inflammaging implies that a low-grade pro-inflammatory status, predisposing the organism to chronic diseases, appears during the ageing process [\[1](#page-3-0)]. A number of reports have provided experimental evidence for this hypothesis and remodeling of the immune system was postulated to drive many age-related disorders [[2\]](#page-3-0). In addition, altered function of innate immune cells, in particular changes in monocytes and macrophages, have been described in mice [\[3](#page-4-0)] and humans [\[4](#page-4-0)]. Clinically, aging is associated with increases of circulating IL-18 and IL-6 plasma levels, whereas IL-1β is undetectable [\[5, 6](#page-4-0)].

During aging, injuries, necrotic cell death and metabolic cell stress accumulate thereby increasing the risk

of chronic inflammation [[7, 8](#page-4-0)]. Dead cells and their metabolites are usually cleared by autophagy though macrophages. A disturbed interplay between autophagy and the inflammasomes was recently postulated to link inflammaging with vascular and other pathologies [[9\]](#page-4-0). The inflammasomes are a family of multiprotein complexes for danger signal recognition that are induced by pathogens or cell debris (damage associated molecular patterns, DAMPS) [[10](#page-4-0), [11](#page-4-0)]. Expression levels of the inflammasome components are generally low and require a two phase induction: A priming phase stimulates gene expression of inactive precursors before a second signal can stimulate assembly of the multiprotein complex consisting of sensor proteins, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated specklike protein with a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) and inflammatory caspases (Caspase-1 or Caspase-5). Upon assembly, the caspases are enzymatically cleaved by the complex resulting in their active form, which then stimulates enzymatic cleavage of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 from inactive precursors [[10](#page-4-0)].

Depending on the initial sensor, several subfamilies are distinguished: The NOD-like receptors (NLR), including NLRP3 and others, act as sensors for intracellular damage associated signals such as cholesterol crystals, nanoparticles, reactive oxygen species and others. The DNA sensors, including Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) act as sensors for intracellular dsDNA [\[10\]](#page-4-0).

Given the recently demonstrated involvement of inflammasome activation in vascular disease [\[12](#page-4-0)–[14](#page-4-0)] and its putative role in inflammaging, we here addressed gene expression of inflammasome components in PBMC of vascular patients in association with age.

## Materials and methods

Venous blood was taken from 77 vascular patients on the day of their hospitalization according to the standard operating procedures of the Vascular Biobank Heidelberg (VBBH). All patients gave their written informed consent to the study, which was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Heidelberg (S-301/2013 and S-412/2013). Patients' characteristics are described in Additional file [1](#page-3-0): Table S1.

PBMC and plasma were separated according to standard procedures (for details see Additional file [2\)](#page-3-0), RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed as described earlier ([[13](#page-4-0)] and Additional file [2](#page-3-0)). Quantitative analysis of gene expression was performed by real time PCR and relative expression was determined by using individual standard amplification curves of each transcript relative to the corresponding mean expression of three reference transcripts (GAPDH plus B2M plus ACTB).

Active, cleaved IL-1β (p17) in plasma was quantified by ELISA, Caspase-1 protein was detected by Western blotting (for details see Additional file [2](#page-3-0)).

## Results and discussion

As shown in Fig. 1, best fit regression revealed a close association of AIM2, NLRP3, ASC, CASP1, CASP5, and IL1B gene expressions with age of the patients. The strongest correlation was found for CASP5 with a correlation coefficient of 0.468 (P = 0.00003). Regression coefficients and p-values of the linear regression analysis are summarized in Table [1](#page-2-0).

To examine, whether the increased expression of inflammasome components resulted in increased activation of the inflammasome multiprotein complex, we next determined the amount of its effector proteins, activated caspase-1 (p10) and activated Il-1β (p17) . Active IL-1β was detected in plasma of 3 out of 30 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and in plasma derived from one patient

with an aortic dissection (data not shown). Western blotting of PBMC lysates showed cleaved, active caspase-1 (p10) together with pro-Caspase-1 (p50) in all samples (Example in Fig. 2a). Neither the IL-1β plasma levels nor the ratio of Caspase-1 p10/p10 + p50, indicating relative activity of the inflammasome complex, were associated with age (data not shown).

To adjust for vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, that might interfere with inflammasome activation [[12](#page-4-0), [15](#page-4-0)], inflammasome gene expression and activities in the group of patients with advanced atherosclerosis (carotid stenosis, peripheral artery disease and arterial stenosis; n = 39) were compared with those derived from patients with other vascular disease (aortic aneurysms, other; n = 38). As shown in Fig. 2, AIM2, NLRP3, ASC, CASP1, and CASP5 gene expressions did not differ between the groups (Fig. 2b-f ). In contrast, IL1B gene expression was significantly higher in the control group compared to the atherosclerosis group (P = 0.0005; Fig. 2g and Additional file [1:](#page-3-0) Table S1). This unexpected finding may be ascribed to the composition of the control group which contained many samples from patients with aortic aneurysms. Locally increased gene

<span id="page-3-0"></span>expression of IL1B is known to be increased in AAA tissue samples [\[16\]](#page-4-0). Whether PBMC from AAA-patients do also express increased levels of IL1B and other inflammasome components is currently under our investigation and will be published in a separate study. No difference in the relative levels of active Caspase-1 (p10) could be detected between the groups (Fig. [2a](#page-2-0) and Additional file 1: Table S1).

Despite some indications from animal experiments [[17\]](#page-4-0), it is currently unknown, whether systemic inflammasome activation is associated with human ageing. Our data present clear evidence for this hypothesis by demonstrating, that gene expression of AIM2, NLRP3, ASC, CASP1, CASP5, and IL1B in PBMC of vascular patients increases with age. Future studies on inflammasome gene expression of PBMC in healthy people of different ages will be necessary to demonstrate whether this phenomenon applies to ageing in general, although the definition of "healthy" might be difficult in individuals above 70 years.

Regardless of the limitation to vascular patients, our findings reinforce results from previous studies, describing age-associated mechanisms that are required for priming of inflammasome components. For example, constitutive transcriptional activity of NF-κB, which is necessary for induction of NLRP3 and IL1B gene expression, has been demonstrated in aged tissues and organisms [\[18](#page-4-0)–[20\]](#page-4-0). In addition, increased levels of the AIM2 protein in human fibroblasts were associated with senescence and increased production of IL-1β [\[21](#page-4-0)].

Since phase-1 activation was not accompanied by increased IL-1β and Caspase-p10 levels in our study, we conclude that full inflammasome assembly and activation, requiring a second signal [\[10\]](#page-4-0), do not occur with a higher frequency in PBMC of the elderly. This is in line with previous reports, demonstrating that PBMC of young and older individuals do not differ in Il-1β release after stimulation with LPS in vitro [\[4](#page-4-0)].

Instead, our data point to an age-associated shift towards a preactivated first line of defense by innate immunity. Given a systemic increase in priming of inflammasome genes through constitutive gene expression in PBMC with ageing, the threshold for full inflammasome activation by the second signal derived from local DAMP recognition in different tissues might be reached earlier and predispose individuals to vascular and other chronic diseases. Cummulative evidence supports the existence of such ageassociated changes in the cellular components of the innate immune system [2, [4](#page-4-0)]. However, as yet, we cannot deduce from our data, whether the increased inflammasome gene expression results from a general activation across all PBMC or from an altered PBMC composition, i.e. an increase in monocyte numbers, as reported previously [[22](#page-4-0)]. Further investigations, addressing this question are currently under examination. In addition, our ongoing studies aim to elucidate the interaction of primed PBMC with vascular tissues and their impact on vascular disease progression. The reason for the increased gene expression of inflammasome components in PBMC during ageing is unknown so far. Besides DAMPS and pathogens serving as immunomodulators, the sympathethic nervous system was recently described to affect the functions of both innate and adaptive immune cells via the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) [\[23](#page-4-0), [24\]](#page-4-0). It remains to be shown, whether ageing-associated changes in β-AR function contribute to altered inflammasome gene expression in PBMC.

In summary, the present study adds important findings to the concept of inflammaging by demonstrating an agedependent increase in activation of innate immunity via systemic priming of inflammasomes in vascular patients.

# Abstract

It's known that the members of the TP53 family are involved in the regulation of female reproduction. Studies in mice showed that the TP73 gene (member of this family) plays a role in the size of follicular pool, ovulation rate and maintenance of genomic stability. In the present study we analyzed data from 605 patients with 37 years attending their first intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The association between the TP73 polymorphism (rs4648551, A>G) and the following parameters related to ovarian reserve, like age, antral follicular count (AFC), anti-Mullerian hormone levels (AMH) and ovarian response prediction index (ORPI) was evaluated. Our results showed an association of the AA genotype with diminished ovarian reserve (AMH <1, AFC 9). Women presenting the AA genotype had a 2.0-fold increased risk for having AMH <1 and AFC 9 (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.23-3.31, P = 0.005). Patients presenting AA genotype had the lowest levels of AMH (P = 0.02), the lowest number of antral follicles (P = 0.01) and the lowest ORPI (P = 0.007). Analyzing the alleles, we can see an enrichment of the A allele in the group of diminished ovarian reserve (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.02-1.83, P = 0.04). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze this polymorphism in humans for assessing the numbers of ovarian follicles and AMH levels and, therefore, the ovarian reserve. Our findings can contribute to the use of this polymorphism as a potential marker of diminished ovarian reserve.

## Introduction

Current studies show that about 17% of couples are unable to conceive and their infertility could stem from different causes, genetic factors representing a significant component [[1](#page-5-0)–[3\]](#page-5-0). The members of the p53 family (p63, p73 and p53), besides their roles in cell cycle regulation, transactivation and apoptosis, are involved in female reproduction and blastocyst implantation [\[4](#page-5-0)]. The p53, p63 and p73 are powerful transcription factors, and small variations in their

are clinics and research centers. All authors are researchers in these companies and declare no real or perceived competing interests. This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.

activation status can cause modifications on the expression pattern of genes that they transcribe, modifying the fate of the cell [\[5\]](#page-5-0).

Studies in mice have showed that the p73 gene plays a role in female infertility. The p73 gene contains two promoters that drive the expression of two major groups of p73 isoforms with opposing cellular actions: pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic [\[6](#page-5-0), [7](#page-5-0)] and both are required for normal embryogenesis [\[8](#page-5-0)]. Mice lacking either one of the groups of isoforms are infertile, but the root of the infertility differ [\[9](#page-5-0)]. Mice that are deficient for both p73 groups of isoforms have sensory defects that prevent them from mating normally [[8\]](#page-5-0). On the other hand, female mice presenting the deletion of exons 2 and 3 of the gene mate normally, but have oocytes with reduced developmental competence, having an increased frequency of spindle defects in ovulated oocytes, reduced follicular pool size and poor oocyte quality [\[9](#page-5-0)], being similar to the set of embryonic defects observed in patients undergoing IVF, particularly older patients [[10\]](#page-5-0). The expression of Tp73 in mice oocytes also declines with natural aging [[9\]](#page-5-0), suggesting that it is involved in maintaining genomic stability in oocytes. Steuerwald and collaborators [\[11\]](#page-5-0) have also seen this down regulation of p73 transcripts in oocyte of older women patients. Another study with women submitted to in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment showed an association of one single nucleotide polymorphism–SNP (rs4648551, A>G) on the TP73 gene with infertility, exhibiting a clear enrichment of the G allele in older infertile women (>35 years) [\[12\]](#page-6-0). Others studies have related the use of SNPs as possible markers to infertility problems [[13](#page-6-0)–[15](#page-6-0)].

Given the importance of this gene in fertility and the possible use of the polymorphisms as a marker to help treatment, we examined the association between one polymorphism on the TP73 gene (rs4648551, A>G) and the following parameters related with ovarian reserve: age, antral follicles count (AFC), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels and the ovarian response prediction index (ORPI = (AMH x AFC)/patient age) [\[16,](#page-6-0) [17\]](#page-6-0). The use of this polymorphism as a marker can be of interest as a potential prognostic factor in cases of human female infertility and could contribute to the improvement in the diagnosis of subfertility and may facilitate personalized strategies in the infertility therapy.

#### Materials and Methods

#### Patients

Our study included blood samples of 605 Brazilian women attending their first intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle between February 2012 and June 2014. The criteria for inclusion were the following: age 37 years, body mass index (BMI) between 20–30 kg/m2 , regular menstrual cycles, both ovaries present, no history of ovarian surgery, no severe endometriosis and no evidence for endocrine disorders or ovarian cysts.

In addition, for comparison of population genotype distribution, a total of 83 volunteer that had at least one healthy child with any infertility treatment were included. The study was authorized by the local ethical committee (the Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa do Centro de Referência da Saúde da Mulher; project reference: 045/11) and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. A written informed consent was obtained from all recruited subjects.

#### DNA extraction and Genotyping

Genomic DNA for all subjects was extracted from the sample of blood for each patient using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions.

Genotyping was performed in duplicate by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using a TaqMan SNP genotyping assay (C\_26892242\_10) according to Applied Biosystems standard protocols. Each 10μl reaction composed of 1μl of genomic DNA (100ng/μl),

<span id="page-2-0"></span>5μl of UMM (TaqMan Universal Master Mix), 0.5μl probe (rs4648551), and 3.5μl of DNasefree water was performed according to the following amplification protocol: denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 92°C for 15s and 60°C for 1min in StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR. Products were analyzed by TaqMan Genotyper Software v1.3 (ABI). Some samples were subjected to sequencing to validate the genotyping results.

#### AMH measurement

AMH was measured using an enzymatically amplified 2-site immunoassay kit (AMH Gen II ELISA, Beckman Coulter Inc.) according to the manufacturer's manual. The lowest detection limit of this assay is 0.01 ng/ml. To minimize the chances of bias in the assay, all sera were processed in duplicate during the same day, using the same measurement kits, and by the same operator. Low and high level controls were included in each assay.

#### Antral follicles count

All women had a transvaginal ultrasonographic evaluation performed during the early follicular phase of a previous cycle before the scheduled treatment. A single experienced sonographer, who was blinded to the results of any hormonal assays and the patient's age, performed the evaluation using a conventional 2-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound at 7 MHz (Medison Digital Color MT; Medison Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea). The total number of 2–9 mm antral follicles in both ovaries was taken in account.

#### Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using StatsDirect version 2.7.9 software, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was applied using an online calculator, available on <http://ihg.gsf.de>. The differences in the frequencies of the SNP genotypes and/or alleles in the study and control groups were evaluated using Fisher's test. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated by logistic regression. All statistical tests were considered significant at a level of P < 0.05.

#### Results

A total of 605 patients and 83 control women were genotyped for the p73 rs4648551 A>G SNP. We found that the genotypes of the study group and control group were similar, having no significant difference in genotype and allelic frequency distributions of p73 rs4648551 A>G SNP [\(Table 1\)](#page-3-0). All allelic and genotypic frequencies observed during this study are consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Analysis of the genotype distribution of the P73 (rs4648551, A>G) polymorphism in the study group, associated with the characters related to ovarian reserve investigated here, revealed a significant difference. Patients that presented the AA genotype had the lowest levels of AMH (P = 0.02), the lowest number of antral follicles (P = 0.01) and the lowest ORPI (P = 0.007). The genotype distribution and the means of AMH levels, AFC and ORPI are presented in [Table 2](#page-3-0). There were no significant difference between the different genotypes and age.

Considering that there is an association of the investigated SNP with some of the characters analyzed, we decided to investigate the influence of the different genotypes with ovarian reserve. When patients with AA genotype were (isolated from patients with AG and GG genotypes, we observed a significant difference of this polymorphism associated with lower AMH levels (P = 0.006), AFC (P = 0.003) and ORPI (P = 0.002). When patients with the GG genotype were isolated, no significant difference was observed. [Table 3](#page-4-0) summarizes our results.

Based on the fact that AA genotype was associated with lower levels of AMH, AFC and ORPI, we divided the patients into two groups: diminished ovarian reserve (AMH <1ng/mL, AFC 9) and normal ovarian reserve (AMH 1ng/mL, AFC>9). The cut-off for diminished ovarian reserve of AMH <1ng/ml was used taken account Nardo, La Marca and colleagues [\[18](#page-6-0), [19\]](#page-6-0). For AFC 9, we used the cut-off based on previous researches associating AMH and AFC [\[20\]](#page-6-0). Odds Ratio analysis was performed to verify an association of the AA genotype with decreased ovarian reserve. Women presenting the AA genotype had a 2.0-fold increased risk for having AMH <1 and AFC 9 (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.23–3.31, P = 0.005). Analyzing the alleles, we detected an enrichment of the A allele in the group of diminished ovarian reserve (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.02–1.83, P = 0.04). Results are shown in [Table 4.](#page-4-0)

#### Discussion

The p53 family members are involved in many important processes, contributing to cell cycle regulation, transactivation and apoptosis in response to DNA damage [\[21](#page-6-0)]. Besides, the members of the p53 family have also been described as regulators of crucial process related to human reproduction [[22](#page-6-0), [23](#page-6-0)]. Observations have shown that the p73 plays a crucial role in maintaining the size of the follicular pool and ovulation rate, as well as acting at the spindle checkpoint [[12](#page-6-0)], affecting the oocyte quality [\[9](#page-5-0)].

Recent studies have revealed that several genetic polymorphisms may play important roles in human reproduction [[4,](#page-5-0) [13](#page-6-0)–[15](#page-6-0)]. The present study investigated the association between the p73 rs4648551 A>G polymorphism and the ovarian reserve in Brazilian women undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment. Given that the p73 gene is associated with fertility, small variations in its activity can cause individual differences on the ovarian reserve and can present as potential targets of reproductive disorders. However, little is known about how this polymorphism acts in the fertility of women.

Our results showed a significant association of AMH levels, AFC and ORPI with the different genotypes of the p73 rs4648551 A>G polymorphism. Despite the fact that Feng and colleagues [\[12\]](#page-6-0) have shown a relationship between this polymorphism and infertile patients with age 35 years, we did not observe this association. The lack of any relationship between this polymorphism and age could be explained in part because we did not include women older than 37 years in order to minimize the ageing effect on ovarian reserve.

Our findings showed an association of the AA genotype and lower mean levels of AMH, AFC and ORPI. Tomasini and collegues [[9\]](#page-5-0) had already shown an association of this gene and follicular numbers in mice.

The division of the study group in two subgroups: diminished ovarian reserve (AMH<1, AFC9) and normal ovarian reserve (AMH1, AFC>9) showed more clearly the association

Data regarding treatment outcome (rFSH dosage, rLH dosage, number of retrieved oocytes and implantation, pregnancy and abortion rates) and TP73 gene polymorphism are under analysis for further publication. In conclusion, this study shows that the p73 rs4648551 A>G polymorphism can be involved in the ovarian reserve. Women with AA genotype have 2.0-fold increased risk for having a diminished ovarian reserve. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze this polymorphism in humans for assessing the numbers of ovarian follicles and AMH levels and, therefore, the ovarian reserve. Additional validation is needed to provide more information regarding the use of this polymorphism as a potential ovarian reserve marker.

A ging is a complex process that affects most living organisms. Over a century of research has revealed that many different intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to our bodies growing old, but we are still a long way from a full understanding of all the mechanisms at play. Recent research has implicated molecules that do not code for proteins in this process, such as long noncoding RNAs. For instance, many of these so-called 'lncRNAs' are expressed differently in patients with agerelated disorders, such as various forms of neurodegenerative disease and cancer ([Rinn and](#page-2-0) [Chang, 2012](#page-2-0)).

Now, in eLife, Joshua Mendell of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and colleagues – including Florian Kopp as first author – report that losing the long noncoding RNA Norad accelerates aging in mice ([Kopp et al., 2019](#page-2-0)). Previous studies have shown that Norad is highly conserved in mammals, and that it is abundant in most human cells ([Lee et al., 2016](#page-2-0); [Tichon et al., 2016](#page-2-0)). The production of Norad increases in response to DNA damage and it helps preserve the genetic information as cells divide. Norad is mainly found in the cytoplasm, where it can bind two PUMILIO proteins (PUM1 and PUM2) that regulate a variety of targets in the cell, including some involved in cell growth and division ([Figure 1](#page-1-0)). Yet, it was unknown what deleting Norad would entail at the level of an organism.

To investigate this question, Kopp et al. – who are based at UTSW, the Nationwide Children's Hospital and Ohio State University – engineered mice that lacked Norad. As the mutant animals grew, they displayed signs of premature aging: their fur thinned down and grayed faster; their spine showed the abnormal curvature associated with old age; their fat reserves dwindled more quickly; and they died earlier. Mice lacking Norad also exhibited several cellular hallmarks of aging ([Lo´pez-Otı´n et al., 2013](#page-2-0)). Many of their cells had the wrong number of chromosomes (as previously seen in Norad-deficient human cells), as well as mitochondria that were showing defects. This was associated with the repression of PUMILIO targets that keep mitochondria working properly. Strikingly, mice engineered to over-produce PUM2 had similar characteristics, clearly indicating that the hyperactivity of PUMI-LIO drives the symptoms associated with a lack of Norad ([Figure 1](#page-1-0)).

On the flipside, a recent study in humans showed that halving the dose of PUM1 leads to developmental delay and seizures ([Gennarino et al., 2018](#page-1-0)), and reducing the amount of PUM1, PUM2, or both results in smaller body size ([Lin et al., 2019](#page-2-0)). These results suggest that mammals must maintain the activity of PUMILIO proteins within a narrow range in order to remain healthy. In fact, the levels of PUM2 proteins in bulk tissues are indistinguishable between control mice and animals that overexpress Pum2. Furthermore, in both Noraddeficient and Pum2-overexpressing mice, most PUMILIO targets are only affected very mildly, yet the animals exhibit striking phenotypes. Kopp et al. argue that repressing many PUMILIO

Figure 1. The Norad-PUMILIO axis. The long noncoding RNA Norad (top) can bind to the PUMILIO proteins PUM1 (pale blue) and PUM2 (pale green) and repress their activity ([Lee et al., 2016](#page-2-0); [Tichon et al., 2016](#page-2-0)). PUM1 and PUM2 also inhibit each other, and they may repress Norad (dotted inhibitory arrow; [Goldstrohm et al., 2018](#page-2-0)). In mice that are genetically engineered to lack Norad or to overproduce PUM2, PUMILIO proteins become overactive and strongly inhibit molecules that prevent damage to mitochondria (bottom dark and light gray structure), as well as molecules that prevent cells from acquiring the wrong number of chromosomes (aneuploidy). As a result, these mice show accelerated aging (bottom; [Kopp et al., 2019](#page-2-0)).

> targets at the same time, even weakly, may trigger the physiological damages observed in these rodents.

> Still, it may also be possible that when the Norad-PUMILIO axis is disrupted, certain cells or tissues are more likely to stop working properly, which in turn creates a snowball effect for the whole organism. For instance, the expression of Norad is highest in the human brain, but it decreases with age in a region that acts as a reservoir to regenerate brain cells (Barry et al., 2015). In simpler organisms, such as the worm

C. elegans, the nervous system acts on other tissues to coordinate pathways that keep proteins in their normal conformation, but these mechanisms become defective with age ([van Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto, 2014](#page-2-0)). It remains unclear whether the nervous system performs such roles in mammals; yet, these results raise the possibility that interactions between Norad and PUMILIO are needed in specific tissues to ward off the effects of age.

Norad is PUMILIO's preferred target, and has several binding sites that are recognized by these proteins. This suggests that this lncRNA can bind a large number of PUMILIO proteins at any given moment, but it is still unclear whether Norad tempers the activity of PUM1 and PUM2 simply by competing with other targets of PUMI-LIO, or if another mechanism is at play ([Goldstrohm et al., 2018](#page-2-0); [Tichon et al., 2018](#page-2-0)).

Curiously, Norad is only found in mammals, whereas the PUMILIO proteins are found in all eukaryotes; it is therefore possible that RNAs with different sequences also buffer the activity of PUMILIO in other species. It remains to be seen how and why mammalian cells rely on Norad to tame the activity of these proteins, as opposed to other types of regulatory mechanisms. Ultimately, the work by Kopp et al. sets the ground for further enquiries into the role of noncoding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins in aging, which could potentially yield new therapeutic approaches for diseases brought by old age.
